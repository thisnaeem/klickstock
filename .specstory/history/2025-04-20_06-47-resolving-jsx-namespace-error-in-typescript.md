# Resolving JSX Namespace Error in TypeScript (2025-04-20 11:47:21)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot find namespace 'JSX'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because the JSX namespace isn't automatically available in TypeScript files. To fix this, you need to import React where the JSX namespace is defined.

---

```diff
  "use client";
  
- import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
+ import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
  import Link from "next/link";
  import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";
```

---

This fixes the error by importing the React namespace, which includes the JSX declaration that TypeScript needs to understand JSX elements.

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Property 'className' does not exist on type 'DialogPortalProps'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because the DialogPortal component from Radix UI doesn't accept a className prop by default. You need to extend the type to include the className property.

---

```diff
    children,
    ...props
- }: DialogPrimitive.DialogPortalProps) => (
+ }: DialogPrimitive.DialogPortalProps & { className?: string }) => (
    <DialogPrimitive.Portal className={cn(className)} {...props}>
      <div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-start justify-center sm:items-center">
```

---

You also need to remove the className prop from the Portal component since it doesn't accept it:

---

```diff
    ...props
  }: DialogPrimitive.DialogPortalProps & { className?: string }) => (
-   <DialogPrimitive.Portal className={cn(className)} {...props}>
+   <DialogPrimitive.Portal {...props}>
      <div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-start justify-center sm:items-center">
        {children}
```

---

This fixes the error by:
1. Adding the `className` property to the type definition
2. Removing the className prop from the Portal component since it doesn't accept it
