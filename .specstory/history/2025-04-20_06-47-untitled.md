_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot find namespace 'JSX'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because the JSX namespace isn't automatically available in TypeScript files. To fix this, you need to import React where the JSX namespace is defined.
